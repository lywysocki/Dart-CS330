## Language Overview and Setup
Dart is a compiled, open-source, general-purpose programming language primarily used for web and mobile app development.

### History
First released on November 14, 2013, Dart is an object-oriented, class-based, garbage-collected programming language designed by Lars Bak and Kasper Lund and developed by Google. With a syntax similar to languages like JavaScript, Java, and C++, Dart was created to address the limitations Google found with JavaScript. Dart is most notably known for its web development capabilities and  Flutter framework, which allows for building cross-platform mobile applications.
