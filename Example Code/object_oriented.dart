/**
 *
 * Create an object (a simple Person or Date object is fine)
    •
    Give the object class attributes (aka instance variables)
    •
    Give the object functions
    •
    Create an object that inherits from the first object (e.g., Student or Appointment) with some attributes and functions of its own
    •
    Test how to instantiate both types of objects, call their functions, and modify their variables.
